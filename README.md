## Introduction
Image enhancement is a process of improving the visual quality of an image. It involves various techniques and algorithms to enhance the image's appearance, making it more suitable for specific applications. This project includes several methods for enhancing images, such as contrast adjustment, noise reduction, and sharpening.

## Features
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Improve the contrast of images using techniques like histogram equalization.
- **Noise Reduction**: Reduce noise in images using filters such as Gaussian and median filters.
- **Sharpening**: Enhance the edges and details in images.
- **Color Correction**: Adjust the color balance of images.
- **Brightness and Saturation Adjustment**: Modify the brightness and saturation levels of images.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PARTH-1712/Image-Enhancement.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Image-Enhancement
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use the provided scripts to enhance your images. Below are some examples of how to use the different enhancement techniques.

### Contrast Enhancement
```python
from enhancement.contrast import enhance_contrast

image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
enhanced_image = enhance_contrast(image_path)
enhanced_image.show()
```

### Noise Reduction
```python
from enhancement.noise_reduction import reduce_noise

image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
denoised_image = reduce_noise(image_path)
denoised_image.show()
```

### Sharpening
```python
from enhancement.sharpen import sharpen_image

image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
sharpened_image = sharpen_image(image_path)
sharpened_image.show()
```

### Brightness and Saturation Adjustment
```python
from enhancement.adjustments import adjust_brightness, adjust_saturation

image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
brightness_adjusted_image = adjust_brightness(image_path, factor=1.2)
saturation_adjusted_image = adjust_saturation(image_path, factor=1.5)
brightness_adjusted_image.show()
saturation_adjusted_image.show()
```

## Examples
